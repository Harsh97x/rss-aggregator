## RSS-feed aggregator

This is a RSS feed aggregator in Go! It's a web server that allows clients to:

* Add RSS feeds to be collected
* Follow and unfollow RSS feeds that other users have added
* Fetch all of the latest posts from the RSS feeds they follow

RSS feeds are a way for websites to publish updates to their content. You can use this project to keep up with your favorite blogs, news sites, podcasts, and more!

## Setup

Before we dive into the project, let's make sure you have everything you'll need on your machine.

1. The latest [Go toolchain](https://golang.org/doc/install).
2. If you're in VS Code, I recommend the official [Go extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.Go).
3. An HTTP client. I use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), but you can use whatever you like.
